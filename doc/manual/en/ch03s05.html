Partitioning your disk simply refers to the act of breaking up your
disk into sections. Each section is then independent of the others.
It's roughly equivalent to putting up walls inside a house; if you add
furniture to one room it doesn't affect any other room.

</p>
<p>

If you already have an operating system on your system

<span class="phrase">
(Windows, OS/2, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, …)
</span>



which uses the whole disk and you want to stick Debian on the same disk, you will need to repartition
it. Debian requires its own hard disk partitions. It cannot be
installed on Windows or Mac OS X partitions. It may be able to share some
partitions with other Unix systems, but that's not covered here. At
the very least you will need a dedicated partition for the Debian
root filesystem.

</p>
<p>

You can find information about your current partition setup by using
a partitioning tool for your current operating system<span class="phrase">, such as the integrated Disk Manager in Windows</span>. Partitioning tools always
provide a way to show existing partitions without making changes.

</p>
<p>

In general, changing a partition with a file system already on
it will destroy any information there. Thus you should always make
backups before doing any repartitioning.  Using the analogy of the
house, you would probably want to move all the furniture out of the
way before moving a wall or you risk destroying it.

</p>
<p>

Several modern operating systems offer the ability to move and resize
certain existing partitions without destroying their contents.  This allows
making space for additional partitions without losing existing data.  Even
though this works quite well in most cases, making changes to the
partitioning of a disk is an inherently dangerous action and should only be
done after having made a full backup of all data.
<span class="phrase">For FAT/FAT32 and NTFS partitions as used by
Windows systems, the ability to move and resize them losslessly is provided 
both by <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> as well as by the integrated Disk Manager of Windows.</span>

</p>
<p>
To losslessly resize an existing FAT or NTFS partition from within <code class="classname">debian-installer</code>, go
to the partitioning step, select the option for manual partitioning, select
the partition to resize, and simply specify its new size.
